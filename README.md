# Data Analysis and Tools Final Project

I've examined that dataset, which comes from a 2014 study that measures attitudes toward mental health and the prevalence of mental health illnesses in the IT workplace, for this assignment.
In this assignment I analyzed attitude of people towards the mental health condition based on the types of job people do geographically.
