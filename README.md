# Data Analysis and Tools Final Project

I've examined that dataset, which comes from a 2014 study that measures attitudes toward mental health and the prevalence of mental health illnesses in the IT workplace, for this assignment.
In this assignment I analyzed attitude of people towards the mental health condition based on the types of job people do geographically.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey

The variables I choose to analyse the attitude are-
•	remote_work: Do you work remotely (outside of an office) at least 50% of the time?

•	benefits: Does your employer provide mental health benefits?

•	care_options: Do you know the options for mental health care your employer provides?

•	mentalhealthconsequence: Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?

•	Country

•	Age

I used these variables to find the mental health consequences on people who are working remotely from different age group in different countries and whether their company give any benefits and care option

# Analysis of people who are working Remotely: remote_work

According to my data, most workers worldwide are employed by tech companies, with a disproportionately high proportion coming from American countries and European countries


# AMERICAN COUNTRIES

The analysis I have done on whether people are having mental health issues while working remotely in American countries 
As per analysis of mental health issues in different countries, American counties has highest health issues.

So here I analyzed whether their employer cares about employess whose are working remotely and having health issues and companies provide them benefits and treatment option but does not provide mental health care option

We found that when employer is providing benefits and treatment option to its employees, In such cases employees those who are working remotely are facing less mental health consequences

So, we can say that even when employees are working remotely but still their employers care about their mental health.

# EUROPEAN COUNTRIES

The analysis I have done on whether people are having mental health issues while working remotely in European countries 

As per analysis of mental health issues in different countries, European counties has second highest health issues

So here I analyzed whether their employer cares about employees whose are working remotely and having health issues and companies provide them benefits and treatment option but does not provide mental health care option

We found that when employer is providing benefits and treatment option to its employees. But still some employees are facing mental health consequences and some employees are not facing health issues which is different from American countries.

So, we can say that even when employees are working remotely in such case some employers care about their mental health, and some doesn’t care.

# Conclusion

After conducting a geographical analysis, I realised that both companies and those who are afflicted have a callous attitude regarding mental health.
